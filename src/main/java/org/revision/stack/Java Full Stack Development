OOPS in Java
OOPS in Java refers to Object-Oriented Programming concepts implemented in the Java programming language. Javaâ€™s OOP features include classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation, enabling modular and efficient code development. Understanding OOPS in Java is essential for building robust, scalable, and maintainable software applications.

Classes of Java
Classes in Java are the blueprint for creating objects and defining their properties and behaviors. They are the fundamental building blocks of Java programs, enabling the creation of reusable and modular code. Classes can contain fields, methods, constructors, and nested classes, providing a wide range of functionality and flexibility.

Interfaces in Java
Interfaces in Java are abstract types that define a set of methods that a class must implement. They provide a way to achieve abstraction, multiple inheritance, and loose coupling in Java programs. Interfaces are useful for defining common behaviors and functionalities that can be shared across different classes, leading to more modular and reusable code. Mastering interfaces in Java is crucial for building flexible and extensible software applications.
